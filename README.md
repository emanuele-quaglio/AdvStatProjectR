## The problem
When working with a database of records, one useful approach is to build a probabilistic network that can reveal the dependencies between the variables in the data. This network can then be applied to predict the future behavior of the system being studied [2]. Despite notable advancements in both the theory and practical implementation of belief networks, the actual process of constructing these networks tends to be challenging and time-consuming. An efficient method is required to estimate the relative likelihoods of various belief-network structures, given a collection of cases and a set of specific assumptions.
## The algorithm
The K2 algorithm [3] is a greedy search method used to construct Bayesian networks by incrementally adding parent nodes to each variable, maximizing the posterior probability of the network structure. It operates under the assumption of a predefined node ordering and uses the following scoring function to evaluate potential parent sets for each node:
<p align=center>$f(i, \pi_i)=\prod_{j=1}^{q_i}\frac{(r_i-1)!}{(N_{ij}+r_i-1)!}\prod_{k=1}^{r_i}\alpha_{ijk}!$</p>

## Network reconstruction
The space of possible node orderings is explored both in a uniformly random way, and through a version of Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm, taking inspiration from [4].
